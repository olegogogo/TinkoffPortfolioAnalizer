### Idea

Use Tinkoff API to calculate real income, but due to huge limitations of API, code has been downgraded to simple parser of your account. This parser gives you xlsx files of your portfolio, so after that you can use it in other instruments. For example, I use it in the DOHOD bond analyser.
